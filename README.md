# Project-1

My A.I agent will be goal based agent that will predict and model meteorite fall frequencies, geographical locations that are most likely to contain these meteorites, and predict the likelihood of a the destruction a meteorite can cause given a historical dataset from nasa that allows for these predictions and calculations to be made. My agent's performance measure will be meteorite detection, that is, finding these landed meteorites for the purpose of research and worldwide safely prediction by modeling how frequent these meteorites fall on a historical timeline to predict possible meteor showers and/or dangerous meteorites based on their given mass. My agent will have a fully observable environment of planet earth, given geographical locations, a timeline, and the masses of the meteorites. My agent's actuators will be predictive outcomes on meteorite landings (by frequency which depends on time), predictive outcomes of meteorite landing locations(which depends on frequency), and the predictive outcome of a meteorite being a worldwide emergency(depends on mass and frequency), all which can be modeled in a probabilistic way using a Bayesian Network. Lastly, my agent will have sensors of gps(world map), time collection, and meteorite mass measurement.
